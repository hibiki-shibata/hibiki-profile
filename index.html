    <h3>-Description-</h3>

    <blockquote>
        In this role, I moved the division from Japan local to Global team and was responsible for the company's
        internal technical/IT support on internal technical matters while performing as a HelpDesk at the same time.
        I’ve been collaborating with the global product team(e.g. software engineers, product leads) and hundled
        variety of things from technical matters to legal matters. And I played the role mainly in English so I got
        used to naturally using English there. These above are what I do in this role.
        To sum up with the role in short, the role is to facilitate shorthanded tasks and communications between
        business team and Product team, by using my technical knowledge/skills.
