        <h3>-Description-</h3>

        <blockquote>
            In this role, I moved the division from Japan local to Global team and was responsible for the company's
            internal technical/IT support on internal technical matters while performing as a HelpDesk at the same
            time.
            I've been collaborating with the global product team(e.g. software engineers, product leads) and hundled
            variety of things from technical matters to legal matters. And I played the role mainly in English so I
            got
            used to naturally using English there. These above are what I do in this role.
            To sum up with the role in short, the role is to facilitate shorthanded tasks and communications between
            business team and Product team, by using my technical knowledge/skills.

            the
            company's partners. I was handling a variety of requests and facilitated communications to/between them.
            As the time went by while I was working in the company, I was getting into the cultures and
            talents(especially
            Product+team) that exist in the company and started thinking I’d like to keep working in this
            organization while
            being inspired by Product+ team for tech world. So, I decided to apply for a position in which I was
            also
            qualified at that point to join the Product+ organization.
